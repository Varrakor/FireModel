# FireModel
Run with python grid.py

To start a fire type "f x y" e.g. f 2 3

To add a firefighter, type "e x y" e.g. e 2 1

Fire currently spreads to 2 random neighbouring trees per step (only doing 4 neighbours for now).

Extinguishers currently put out one cell of fire per step

Tree density affects density of trees, 0 is all empty space, 1 is all trees.
