# FireModel
To initialise, run cells 1 and 2.

To run a manual step-through simulation, run cell 3

To run automatic simulations run cell 4 and 5.

To change the number of firefighters and firebreaks used, alter arrays on lines 7 and 8. Arrays can be different sizes.

Note: Cell outputs are not identical to those seen in the report as we reused the same cells multiple times during experiments, however, the screenshots have been included.
